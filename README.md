Project Title:  iSketch

Artist Statement: 
Painting is a popular branch of art which has thousands of years history. Given its popularity and history, painting is also one of the most mature forms of art that embraces many different patterns of expressions with different drawing tools. Hands and drawing tablets are two common ways of drawing nowadays but have you ever thought about drawing with your laptop? This project intends to enable people to realize this dream. Based on Javascript and P5, iSketch is a web page where users can freely display their drawing creativity. By combining several basic P5 functions such as line, color  and erase, iSketch can enable users to realize the effect of traditional hand painting. While via using functions like slider, shapes and animation, iSketch can give users much more new drawing experience such as producing their ideal color or drawing with changing shapes. Painting is an old form of art while coding is a new pattern of expression. By merging these two art elements, this project is aimed not only to extend the portfolio of painting, but also act as a bridge between connecting the old and the new.)

Instructions:
iSketch is a program aiming to provide users with a unique experience of drawing -- drawing with P5 Javascript. Users can explore different drawing tools by clicking each tool button and drag/double-click their mouse on the paper. After they finish their drawings, users are able to save the work to their computers and start a new page. Here are detailed explanations for each tool:
1. Paint. Paint is designed to perform the most basic function of drawing --drawing lines. Click the paint button to start. Drag the mouse on the paper just like using a pen. The weight and color of the line can be altered by dragging the sliders below the paint button (3 sliders for r,g,b and one for the weight ”#”) There will be a preview next to the paint button to show you how the line will be like now so that you can easily create a line that they really need. 
2. Erase. Same as paint, start the erase function by clicking the erase button. iSketch offers three sizes of erasers to cater to different scenarios. You can select the size they want by clicking the corresponding “erase square”.
3. Save. Click on the Save button and then a file named “mySketch.png” will be downloaded to  your computer.
4. New Paper. Click on the New Paper button and then all things on the “paper” will be deleted and you will get a new paper to draw.
5. Shapes and animation. This part consists of three steady shapes-- circle, rectangle and star, and two animated shapes--popping heart and a “bonus” flower. First, click the shape button that you want. Then use  slides to adjust the color and size of the shape, you can see the preview under shape buttons. When you get the shape you want, you can double-click on the paper to place that shape wherever you want : ) ~~
